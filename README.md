### Hi there👋 

I’m [Valen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valenvivian/?locale=en_US) a Technical Recruiter 🕵️‍♀️ who loves tech but meeting new people and learning from them even more, so nice to *e-meet* you!  
Originally from Argentina 🇦🇷 but now living my best Nomad Life in Spain 🇪🇸 thanks to [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/BLDrd0/worlds-top-talent), one of the biggest fully remote companies that connects the top talent with top organizations around the globe 🌎

My fav question for my candidates: *Have you ever thought about working from anywhere ✈️?* It could sound unrealistic but while I have been working with Toptal I had the chance to take my laptop and visit:

- 🇮🇹 Milan
- 🇳🇱 Tilburg
- 🇵🇹 Lisbon

And I'm planning to make that list even bigger! 

If I can do it, you too 🥳 Choose your next remote projects by joining the greatest IT community of freelance tech experts!
